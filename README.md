# 🇮🇳 Indian Sign Language Recognition

A dual-version project aimed at recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) hand gestures in real time. This system is built to promote accessibility and foster inclusive communication by translating ISL gestures into text.

## 🔀 Project Versions

### 🧠 Version 1: Machine Learning Model

Live Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ip8d4NJDdsUz1BJOQ8EAsz6bWUCMXd_w/view

A self-trained model using classical machine learning techniques for ISL alphabet recognition.

#### 📌 Highlights
- Custom dataset built with OpenCV (50 images per alphabet)
- MediaPipe used for hand landmark detection
- Random Forest Classifier used for gesture classification
- Real-time alphabet detection via webcam
- Achieves ~89% accuracy

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn

#### 📁 Structure
- Captured images stored in labeled folders (A-Z)
- Preprocessed landmarks used as input features for the model

- Cloud-based processing eliminates local training requirements
- User-friendly interface using Gradio

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Gemini API
- Gradio (optional for web interface)

#### 🔐 API Usage
- Requires a valid Gemini API key
- Images or frames from webcam are sent to the API for gesture interpretation
